-- Test Vector Search in CockroachDB SQL Shell
-- These are examples you can run directly in the SQL shell

-- 1. Simple vector search using an existing embedding
SELECT expense_id, description, expense_amount, merchant, 
       embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM expenses LIMIT 1) as similarity_score 
FROM expenses 
ORDER BY embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM expenses LIMIT 1) 
LIMIT 5;

-- 2. Search for grocery-related expenses using a zero vector (for demo)
SELECT expense_id, description, expense_amount, merchant,
       embedding <-> '[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]' as similarity_score
FROM expenses 
WHERE description ILIKE '%grocery%' OR merchant ILIKE '%safeway%' OR merchant ILIKE '%walmart%'
ORDER BY similarity_score 
LIMIT 10;

-- 3. Show the actual explain plan for vector search
EXPLAIN (VERBOSE) 
SELECT expense_id, description, expense_amount, merchant,
       embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM expenses WHERE description ILIKE '%coffee%' LIMIT 1) as similarity_score
FROM expenses 
ORDER BY embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM expenses WHERE description ILIKE '%coffee%' LIMIT 1)
LIMIT 5;

-- 4. Check vector index usage
SHOW INDEXES FROM expenses;

-- 5. Check table statistics
SHOW STATISTICS FOR TABLE expenses;
