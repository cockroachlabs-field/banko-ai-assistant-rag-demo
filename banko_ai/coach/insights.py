"""Coach insights — aggregation tools that turn raw expenses into the
analyses a real PFM agent needs to ground its nudges in evidence:

  - get_monthly_summary: total + by-category + top merchants for a month
  - get_spending_velocity: pace vs. budget, projected end-of-month
  - get_top_merchants: ranked merchants by spend over a window
  - detect_subscriptions: recurring-merchant + amount-drift detector

All functions accept `database_url` explicitly so the MCP server and
tests can pin the DB independent of process env.

Returns are JSON-serializable so the MCP layer can pass them through.
