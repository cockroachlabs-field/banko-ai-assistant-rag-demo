"""
Intent classifier for Banko AI.

Two-stage gate. A cheap lexical/fuzzy pre-pass catches the common case where
the query obviously names a financial concept ("delta expenses", "$42 at
starbucks", "how much did I spend on groceries") — including typos like
"delta exepnses" that MiniLM-anchor cosine similarity scores below threshold.
Only queries that miss the lexical gate fall through to the embedding check.

Why the lexical pre-pass exists: before the embedding gate was added
(2026-03-17, commit f93782d), every query went straight to RAG and the LLM
itself was robust to typos. The embedding gate intercepted before the LLM
could see them; the pre-pass restores that tolerance for queries that name
known financial signals.
